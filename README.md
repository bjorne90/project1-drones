# Project 1 - Drone Flyers

This is a website that is basically built on HTML and CSS. The site's purpose is to gather drone enthusiasts to share photos with each other, their flights and have contact with each other.

The users' photos can be seen by anyone who visits the page, as well as visitors can see the users' flights.
